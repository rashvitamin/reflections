When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?


Lect 10 :

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

My manually pulling changes we have control over the changes happening in the local repository. Had it been automatic- it would be like dropbox and we are working on one things and something else which might have been linked will be changed automatically creating a messy situation.
